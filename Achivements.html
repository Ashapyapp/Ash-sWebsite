      <h3>Typing</h3>
      <p>
        Talking about Typing, I really improved by using some of websites, That
        really pumped my typing speed. At first I had 45WPM which is very low
        compared to a Stuff I love (Programming). So I took typing seriously.
        Websites like
        <a href="https://www.typing.com">Typing.com</a> and
        <a href="https://www.monkeytype.com">MonkeyType</a>. I used these both
        websites for both separate use cases. I used the free typing learning
        course from Typing.com. Which really made me understand which finger to
        use for which letters, Which made a huge improvement. And for practicing
        I used MonkeyType, Plus I really like the design of the website. It's
        very Aesthetic!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have almost have 80 WPM with 97% Accuracy now! Here's a Certificate
        that i gained from
        <a href="https://www.typing.com">Typing.com</a>.

      <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
      <div class="java">
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
          I'm huge fan of coding, So all I do to learn new languages when I have
          free time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I Learned this course interactively from a free website called
          <a href="https://www.codelearn.io">Codelearn.io</a>. This Website is a
          God's Gift. Because I have litteraly starved for these kind of
          websites. for example; you all know the
          <a href="https://www.programiz.com">Programiz</a>. But It all got
          asking me for subscription. So After research, I got This treasure!
        </p>
        <p>
          I Learned Java Fundamentals From
          <a href="https://www.codelearn.io">Codelearn.io</a>. Here's a
          Certificate I gained for java Fundamentals.

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
          I actually Learned my first language in my school, I learned python.
          Even though I learn many languages now, My favorite is still Python!
        </p>
        <p>
          Felt like python was my first love!!. So in school they thaught me for
          2 years. It was quite a good journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I didn't had a proper certification from the school. I never had
          a proper Evidence. So I learned it from
          <a href="https://www.codelearn.io">Codelearn.io</a> Again!. Here's the
          certification for python!
