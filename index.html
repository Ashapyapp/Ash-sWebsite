      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Ashik and I'm a 17-year-old boy from Tamil Nadu,
        India. On this page, you can learn about my interests and hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at
        Amrita Engineering and Technology. I'm fascinated by the logic behind
        computers and I'm particularly interested in data science.
      </p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>

      <h2>Things I Use</h2>
      <p>
        I don't use anything expensive. I have an old HP Pavilion dv6 laptop,
        which I've upgraded with some new parts to make it more usable.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I added a 4GB DDR3 1800MHz RAM module from my old Lenovo laptop, which
          surprisingly worked very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          I replaced the hard disk with an SSD, as I noticed the disk usage was
          unreasonably high. I now use a 128GB SSD.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As for operating systems, I used to be a big fan of Windows, but
        recently I switched to Kali Linux. I love the terminal in Linux and I'm
        preparing to switch to a Mac soon.
