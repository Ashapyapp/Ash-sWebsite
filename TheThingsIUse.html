          I don't use anything expensive. I have an old HP Pavilion dv6 laptop,
          which I've upgraded with some new parts to make it more usable.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I added a 4GB DDR3 <em><strong>1800</strong></em> RAM module from my
            old Lenovo laptop, which surprisingly worked very well.
          </li>

          <li>
            I replaced the hard disk with an SSD, as I noticed the disk usage
            was unreasonably high. I now use a 128GB SSD.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As for operating systems, I used to be a big fan of Windows, but
          recently I switched to Kali Linux. I love the terminal in Linux and
          I'm preparing to switch to a Mac soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Talking about phone I use the android phone. Because why not. Android is the best. To be precise I use Realme 6 pro. Which was launched back in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>So yeah, that was all of my Things I Use Section. If I change my Gadgets I use, I'll sure update here!</p>
